## Insights

- vaulting of payment card data (avoid liability and being locked-in to a payment provider)
- analytics on card scheme, brand, type, currency, banks
- risk assessment based on geolocation, ip address, black lists
- 1-click payment solution, driving impulsive sales up by 55%, removing the barrier of card details re-entry
- automated AML checks on passports/IDs
- GDPR compliant personal identifiable information (PII) storage

### Store a payment card
#### Request

curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/v1/card \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "holder": "leonardo", # Cardholder name
    "number": "4415281263901560", # Payment card number
    "exp_month": 1, # Expiry month
    "exp_year": 2022, # Expiry year

## Tech stack

We use [protobuf]() to serialize the data and [gRPC](https://grpc.io) to transport it, for compatibility we also support JSON serilization over HTTP transport via reverse-proxy, auto-generated thanks to [grpc-gateway](), which also generates the [Swagger]() documentation, available at https://doc.fireblaze.io/card.

Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using [AES-GCM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/168.pdf) and an [HSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module) module to generate entropy for the encryption keys which must be [FIPS 140-2 Level 3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf) certified to meet compliance. Check the [kms](pkg/kms) service for the [GCP CloudKMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/) implementation. Feel free to extend the interface with other implementations e.g. [AWS CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm)

We like to think of data in graphs, leveraging [ent](https://entgo.io/) as our entity framework, which supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Gremlin.

The infrastructure is designed around [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) with the goal of passing [PCI-DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf?agreement=true&time=1573855946115) Level 1 compliance.

The pipelines run on our self-hosted [Gitlab](https://code.fireblaze.io/users/sign_in), feel free to request access, you can sign-in with your Github account.

Fireblaze Vault is currently in [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) status, we're proud to solve this challenge and excited to share it with the community.
